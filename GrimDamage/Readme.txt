    ^bRacial Bonus Damage:  (0.000000)
    criticalStrike = 1.000000






nice to have:
* show stats of enemies, off, def, etc..
* records/skills/playerclass06/pets/winddevil_05.dbr
    attackerName = records/skills/playerclass06/pets/winddevil_05.dbr
* Detect death and automatically show what killed you
* How much dps from racial?
* is the dps correct? verify with dot etc
* in .js, if you 've gone X updates without doing any damage, might as well tag him as out-of-combat, and stop updating the graph
* "war cry" reduction % to health does not register at all, should it?
